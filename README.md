# Data-Transmission-and-Reception-with-Error-Detection-circuitry
Designed and implemented a system to transmit and receive data which enhanced reliability using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) techniques. The project involved developing error detection circuitry to ensure data integrity during transmission over potentially noisy channels.
